## Short bio

I completed my Master's degree in Psychology, with a specialization in Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience, at the University of liège (Belgium) in 2012. In my dissertation, I explored the link between musical long-term memory knowledge and short-term memory capacity for music (supervisor: Prof. Steve Majerus). Next, I completed a Ph.D. in Psychology (2012---2017) at the Psychology and Neuroscience of Cognition ([PsyNCog](https://www.psyncog.uliege.be/cms/c_4267499/en/portail-psyncog)) research unit at the University of Liège. For my doctoral dissertation, I performed a series of studies aiming to better understand the cognitive architecture of short-term memory for music in the light of recent theoretical models developed in the verbal domain (supervisor: Prof. Steve Majerus). After my Ph.D., I moved to Switzerland, starting a 3-year postdoctoral position with Prof. Pierre Barrouillet at the University of Geneva, working on the *maxispan project* aiming to reassess the capacity of working memory, as well as on several personal research projects. Since May 2020, I started a postdoc position at the Swiss Distance Learning Institute, working with Prof. Nicolas Rothen and Prof. Thomas Reber on the *Stellar Learning* project. This project aims to investigate the extent to which the use of language learning apps benefits beyond traditional learning approaches in learning a foreign language.
